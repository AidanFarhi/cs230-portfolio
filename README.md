# Project 3 - Sofware Design Template

#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client is a gaming company. They wanted to create a web-based version
of their Android game, Draw It or Lose It. The game needed to be playable via a web browser
and have the same functionality as the mobile version. It also needed to support multiple
games, teams, and players.

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe did a good job of identifying the key technical requirements and translating
them to reasonable and real-world proposed solutions. I also did my best to thouroughly 
explain each design choice, diagram, and technical concept.

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think it helped to have all of the requirements and technical specifications in one place.
When writing the code, it helped to have a visual class diagram.

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The document uses specific and technical language. As an improvement, I would incorporate
more simplified explainations of each technical concept. This would help a less technical
reader to understand the document better.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I translated the high-level description of what the client wanted to real-world 
software design concepts and recommendations. When a non-technical client engages you to build a solution,
they are trusting that you will leverage your expertise and domain knowledge to craft software
that meets their needs. This is the essence of software engineering, and 
should be the aim of all development efforts.

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach to software design is to translate the requirements into technical components.
I draw on past knowledge and experience to build out an initial draft.
If I cannot think of a solution to a particular constraint or requirement, I will do
research and come up with an option.
There are usually many options for a given requirement, so I do my best to choose simple,
proven, and widely adopted solutions. Keeping the design as simple as possible while meeting
the requirements helps to reduce complexity, time-to-market, and headaches down the road.
